Question 1
Suppose I define the following function in R
cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}
What is the result of running
cube(3)
in R after defining this function?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
A warning is given with no value returned.			
An error is returned because 'n' is not specified in the call to 'cube'			
The number 27 is returned	Correct	1.00	Because 'n' is not evaluated, it is not needed even though it is a formal argument.
The users is prompted to specify the value of 'n'.

Question 2
The following code will produce a warning in R.
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
        x <- 0
}
Why?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
There are no elements in 'x' that are greater than 5			
The syntax of this R expression is incorrect.			
'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.	Correct	1.00	
You cannot set 'x' to be 0 because 'x' is a vector and 0 is a scalar.			
The expression uses curly braces.

Question 3
Consider the following function
f <- function(x) {
        g <- function(y) {
                y + z
        }
        z <- 4
        x + g(x)
}
If I then run in R
z <- 10
f(3)
