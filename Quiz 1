Introduction
This first quiz will check your ability to execute basic operations on objects in R and to understand some basic concepts. For questions 11–20 you will need to load a dataset into R and do some basic manipulations in order to answer the questions on the quiz.

You may want to print a copy of the quiz questions to look at as you work on the assignment. It is recommended that you save your answers as you go in the event that a technical problem should occur with your network connection or computer. Ultimately, you must submit the quiz online to get credit!

Question 1
R was developed by statisticians working at

The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.			
The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.

array	Correct	1.00	'array' is not an atomic data type in R.
character			
integer			
logical

Question 4
If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
matrix			
numeric			
complex			
integer	Correct	1.00	The 'L' suffix creates an integer vector as opposed to a numeric vector.
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 5
What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
logical			
mixed			
character	Correct	1.00	The character class is the "lowest common denominator" here and so all elements will be coerced into that class.
numeric			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

R does automatic coercion of vectors so that all elements of the vector are the same data class.
Question 6
If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
a 2 by 3 matrix			
a vector of length 2			
a 2 by 2 matrix			
a 3 by 2 numeric matrix	Correct	1.00	The 'cbind' function treats vectors as if they were columns of a matrix. It then takes those vectors and binds them together column-wise to create a matrix.
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 7
A key property of vectors in R is that
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
elements of a vector all must be of the same class	Correct	1.00	
the length of a vector must be less than 32,768			
elements of a vector can be of different classes			
a vector cannot have have attributes like dimensions

a numeric vector with the values 1, 2, 5, 7.			
an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.	Correct	1.00	
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 10
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
x[x >= 10] <- 4			
x[x < 10] <- 4			
x[x == 4] > 10			
x[x >= 11] <- 4	Correct	1.00	You can create a logical vector with the expression x >= 11 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.
Total		1.00 / 1.00
